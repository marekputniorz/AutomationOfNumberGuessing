# AutomationOfNumberGuessing

This was my first homework on the University from subject of programming.
I had to made a program which will guess the random number from 0 - 100. The algorithm is very easy.
First of all I needed the half the range which is 50. Then I made some conditions for guessing the number. 
I compared the number 50 with a random number which computer generates and then the program decided which range is it.
Then it was very easy.
